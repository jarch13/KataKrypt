## Introduction

In today's digital age, protecting your personal information is more important than ever. **KataKrypt** provides an easy way to secure your sensitive data by encrypting it and hiding it within images. With the addition of keyfiles, you have even more control over your data's security. This guide will walk you through every step, ensuring you can use the program confidently, even if you're new to encryption.

## What is KataKrypt?

**KataKrypt** is a software application that encrypts text files and embeds the encrypted data into images using steganography. By utilizing passwords and keyfiles, your sensitive information is both encrypted and hidden, adding multiple layers of security.

---

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design.
- **Strong Encryption**: Protects your data using a custom encryption algorithm.
- **Steganography**: Hides encrypted data within images.
- **Password and Keyfile Protection**: Secure your data with a password, a keyfile, or both.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems.

---

## Understanding Basic Concepts

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a password or key. Only someone with the correct password or key can decrypt and read the original data.

### Steganography

Steganography involves hiding data within other non-secret text or data. In KataKrypt, your encrypted text is hidden within image files, making it inconspicuous and adding an extra layer of protection.

### Keyfiles

A keyfile is a file that contains cryptographic key material used for encryption and decryption. Keyfiles can be used in place of or in addition to a password, enhancing security by requiring possession of a specific file to access the encrypted data.

---

## Authentication Options

### Password Guidelines

Creating a strong password is crucial for the security of your data.

- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters
- **Include**:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)

**Tips**:

- Avoid common words or phrases.
- Do not use personal information like names or birthdays.
- Use a combination of unrelated words and characters.

### Using Keyfiles

A keyfile adds an extra layer of security by requiring a specific file to unlock your encrypted data.

#### Generating a Keyfile

1. During the authentication step, check the **Use Keyfile** box.
2. Click **Generate Keyfile**.
3. Choose a save location and filename for your keyfile.
4. Keep your keyfile in a secure location.

#### Using an Existing Keyfile

1. Check the **Use Keyfile** box.
2. Click **Browse** and navigate to your keyfile.
3. Select the keyfile and click **Open**.

#### Security Tips

- Store your keyfile in a secure, backed-up location.
- Do not share your keyfile with others.
- Use both a password and a keyfile for maximum security.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can I encrypt any type of file?**

  Currently, KataKrypt supports encryption of `.txt` files.

- **What if I forget my password or lose my keyfile?**

  For security reasons, passwords and keyfiles are not recoverable. If you forget your password or lose your keyfile, you will not be able to decrypt the data.

- **Is it more secure to use both a password and a keyfile?**

  Yes, using both provides two-factor authentication, significantly enhancing security.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Error during encryption or decryption.

**Solution**: Ensure you are selecting the correct file types and that you have the necessary file permissions. Verify that the password and keyfile entered during decryption match those used during encryption.

---

**Problem**: I can't find my keyfile.

**Solution**: Check the location where you saved the keyfile during generation. If you cannot locate it, and you used only a keyfile (without a password), you will not be able to decrypt your data.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, protecting your personal information is more important than ever. **KataKrypt** provides an easy way to secure your sensitive data by encrypting it and hiding it within images. With the addition of keyfiles, you have even more control over your data's security. This guide will walk you through every step, ensuring you can use the program confidently, even if you're new to encryption.

---

## What is KataKrypt?

**KataKrypt** is a software application that encrypts text files and embeds the encrypted data into images using steganography. By utilizing passwords and keyfiles, your sensitive information is both encrypted and hidden, adding multiple layers of security.

---

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design.
- **Strong Encryption**: Protects your data using custom encryption algorithms.
- **Steganography**: Hides encrypted data within images.
- **Password and Keyfile Protection**: Secure your data with a password, a keyfile, or both.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems.

---

## Understanding Basic Concepts

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a password or key. Only someone with the correct password or key can decrypt and read the original data.

### Steganography

Steganography involves hiding data within other non-secret text or data. In KataKrypt, your encrypted text is hidden within image files, making it inconspicuous and adding an extra layer of protection.

### Keyfiles

A keyfile is a file that contains cryptographic key material used for encryption and decryption. Keyfiles can be used in place of or in addition to a password, enhancing security by requiring possession of a specific file to access the encrypted data.

---

## How KataKrypt Works

KataKrypt combines several cryptographic and data-hiding techniques to secure your messages. Below is a detailed explanation of the algorithms used and how they work together in the encryption and decryption processes.

### Algorithms Used

#### 1. Key Derivation Function (KDF)

**Purpose**: Converts your password (and optional keyfile data) into a secure encryption key.

**How it Works**:

- **Input**: Your password and optional keyfile data.
- **Process**: Uses cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to generate a fixed-length key from the input.
- **Output**: A secure key used for encryption and decryption.

**Why It's Important**: The KDF ensures that even if your password is simple, the resulting key is strong and unpredictable.

#### 2. Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)

**Purpose**: Generates a pseudorandom keystream used in the encryption process.

**How it Works**:

- **Input**: The secure key from the KDF.
- **Process**: Applies the LCG formula to produce a sequence of pseudorandom numbers.
- **Output**: A keystream of random numbers.

**Why It's Important**: The keystream adds randomness to the encryption, making it harder to decrypt without the key.

#### 3. Stream Cipher

**Purpose**: Encrypts your plaintext message by combining it with the keystream.

**How it Works**:

- **Input**: The plaintext message and the keystream from the LCG.
- **Process**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the plaintext and the keystream.
- **Output**: Encrypted ciphertext.

**Why It's Important**: The stream cipher ensures that your message is securely encrypted using the keystream.

#### 4. Block Cipher

**Purpose**: Adds an additional layer of security by rearranging and substituting parts of the encrypted message.

**How it Works**:

- **Input**: The ciphertext from the stream cipher.
- **Process**:
  - **Substitution**: Replaces bytes in the data using a substitution box (S-box).
  - **Permutation**: Rearranges the bytes according to a predefined pattern.
- **Output**: Further encrypted data.

**Why It's Important**: The block cipher obscures patterns in the data, making it even more secure.

#### 5. Steganography using Least Significant Bit (LSB) Technique

**Purpose**: Hides the encrypted data within an image file.

**How it Works**:

- **Input**: The doubly encrypted data and a cover image.
- **Process**:
  - Converts the encrypted data into binary form.
  - Modifies the least significant bits of the image's pixels to embed the data.
- **Output**: A stego image that appears unchanged but contains the hidden data.

**Why It's Important**: Steganography conceals the fact that a message exists, providing an additional layer of security.

### Encryption Process Overview

1. **Key Generation**: KDF generates a secure key from your password and keyfile.
2. **Keystream Generation**: LCG uses the key to produce a keystream.
3. **Initial Encryption**: Stream cipher encrypts your message using the keystream.
4. **Enhanced Encryption**: Block cipher further encrypts the data through substitution and permutation.
5. **Data Hiding**: LSB steganography embeds the encrypted data into an image.

### Decryption Process Overview

1. **Data Extraction**: LSB steganography extracts the encrypted data from the image.
2. **Reverse Block Cipher**: Applies inverse permutation and substitution to decrypt the data.
3. **Stream Cipher Decryption**: Uses the keystream to decrypt the data back to plaintext.
4. **Key Regeneration**: KDF regenerates the key from your password and keyfile to ensure the same keystream is produced.

## Authentication Options

### Password Guidelines

Creating a strong password is crucial for the security of your data.

- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters
- **Include**:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)

**Tips**:

- Avoid common words or phrases.
- Do not use personal information like names or birthdays.
- Use a combination of unrelated words and characters.

### Using Keyfiles

A keyfile adds an extra layer of security by requiring a specific file to unlock your encrypted data.

#### Generating a Keyfile

1. During the authentication step, check the **Use Keyfile** box.
2. Click **Generate Keyfile**.
3. Choose a save location and filename for your keyfile.
4. Keep your keyfile in a secure location.

#### Using an Existing Keyfile

1. Check the **Use Keyfile** box.
2. Click **Browse** and navigate to your keyfile.
3. Select the keyfile and click **Open**.

#### Security Tips

- Store your keyfile in a secure, backed-up location.
- Do not share your keyfile with others.
- Use both a password and a keyfile for maximum security.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Can I encrypt any type of file?**

  Currently, KataKrypt supports encryption of `.txt` files.

- **What if I forget my password or lose my keyfile?**

  For security reasons, passwords and keyfiles are not recoverable. If you forget your password or lose your keyfile, you will not be able to decrypt the data.

- **Is it more secure to use both a password and a keyfile?**

  Yes, using both provides two-factor authentication, significantly enhancing security.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Error during encryption or decryption.

**Solution**: Ensure you are selecting the correct file types and that you have the necessary file permissions. Verify that the password and keyfile entered during decryption match those used during encryption.

---

**Problem**: I can't find my keyfile.

**Solution**: Check the location where you saved the keyfile during generation. If you cannot locate it, and you used only a keyfile (without a password), you will not be able to decrypt your data.
